# PCA-GLUE for Ultrasound Elastography
PCA-GLUE is a method used for strain estimation in Ultrasound Elastography.

This is the code used by Abdelrahman Zayed in the IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control (TUFFC) journal paper entitled "Fast Strain Estimation and Frame Selection in Ultrasound Elastography using Machine Learning".
