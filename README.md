# PCA-GLUE for Ultrasound Elastography
PCA-GLUE is a method used for strain estimation in Ultrasound Elastography.

This is the code used by Abdelrahman Zayed in
1. **The IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control (TUFFC) journal paper entitled "Fast Strain Estimation and Frame Selection in Ultrasound Elastography using Machine Learning".**
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9091615
2. **The IEEE 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) paper entitled "Fast approximate time-delay estimation in ultrasound elastography using principal component analysis".**

## How it works
It is very easy to test this code, you will simply need to run the example_phantom.m file using Matlab.
